# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 20, 2025

---

## Introduction

Welcome to Rituals ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application.

**TL;DR:** We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. Everything stays on your device.

---

## Information We Don't Collect

### Personal Data

We **do not** collect:
- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- IP addresses
- Any other personally identifiable information

### Usage Data

We **do not** collect:
- App usage statistics
- Feature usage data
- Crash reports
- Analytics data

### Ritual Data

Your rituals (titles, descriptions, times) are stored **only on your device**. We never:
- Upload them to our servers
- Share them with third parties
- Access them in any way

---

## How the App Works

### Local Storage Only

All data is stored using your device's local storage (shared_preferences on iOS/macOS, localStorage on Web). This means:

- **iOS/macOS:** Data saved in app sandbox (inaccessible to other apps)
- **Web:** Data saved in browser storage (specific to your browser)
- **No cloud:** No synchronization, no backups, no external storage

### Notifications

Notifications are generated locally by your device:

- **Local only:** No push notification servers involved
- **Scheduled locally:** Your device handles all scheduling
- **No tracking:** We don't know if/when you receive notifications

---

## Data Security

### Your Responsibility

Since all data stays on your device, security depends on:

- Your device's security (passcode, Face ID, etc.)
- Your backups (if you back up your device, rituals are included)

### Our Responsibility

We ensure:

- No data transmission over network
- No security vulnerabilities in our code
- Regular security updates

---

## Third-Party Services

### None in MVP

We **do not** use:

- Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Crash reporting (e.g., Crashlytics, Sentry)
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Any other third-party services that would access your data

---

## Children's Privacy

Rituals is suitable for all ages (rated 4+). We do not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

---

## International Users

Since we don't collect data, there are no international data transfer concerns. Your data never leaves your device regardless of your location.

---

## Your Rights

### Data Access

You can access your ritual data at any time by opening the app. It's stored on your device and always available to you.

### Data Deletion

To delete your data:

1. Delete individual rituals within the app, or
2. Uninstall the app (removes all data)

### Data Export

**MVP:** No export feature (data stays on device only)

**Future:** We plan to add import/export in a future version, giving you full control to back up your rituals.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted:

- In the app (if significant changes)
- On our website (rituals.app/privacy)
- In App Store update notes (if required)

We'll notify you of material changes and ask for consent if required by law.

---

## Future Features

### Planned (Post-MVP)

If we add cloud sync or other features that involve data transmission, we will:

1. Update this policy with detailed information
2. Ask for your explicit consent before enabling
3. Make it opt-in only (never forced)
4. Provide end-to-end encryption

You'll always have the choice to keep using the local-only version.

## Compliance

### GDPR (EU Users)

Since we don't collect data, most GDPR obligations don't apply. However:

- **Right to erasure:** Delete rituals or uninstall app
- **Right to access:** Your data is always accessible in the app
- **Right to portability:** (Planned for future version)

### CCPA (California Users)

We don't sell personal information (we don't collect any).

### Other Jurisdictions

Our "no data collection" approach complies with most privacy laws worldwide.

# Rituals MVP - AI Agent Roles

## Role Chain
PRD → Product Owner → UX/UI Designer → Tech Lead → Developer → QA → MVP

## How to Use
```
Act as [Role Name]. [Your request]
```

## Available Roles

1. **Product Owner** (`roles/1_product_owner.md`)
   - Creates tasks with acceptance criteria from PRD
   - Guards MVP scope
   
2. **UX/UI Designer** (`roles/2_ux_ui_designer.md`)
   - Designs flows (max 7 steps), screen blueprints, and visual style
   
3. **Tech Lead** (`roles/3_tech_lead.md`)
   - Designs architecture, interfaces, data models
   
4. **Developer** (`roles/4_developer.md`)
   - Implements code following tech design
   
5. **QA Reviewer** (`roles/5_qa_reviewer.md`)
   - Tests and issues verdict: MVP READY or NOT READY

## Key Principle
All roles treat `docs/PRD.md` as immutable source of truth.

## How to Use (Slash Commands)

Type `/` in Cursor chat to select a role:
```
/product-owner    - Break PRD into tasks
/ux-ui-designer   - Design flows + screens + visual style
/tech-lead        - Design architecture + interfaces
/developer        - Implement code
/qa-reviewer      - Test and issue verdict
```

**Each role is locked to its scope** and will refuse out-of-scope work.

## Example Workflow
```
Chat 1: /product-owner - Create tasks for [feature]
Chat 2: /ux-ui-designer - Design flows for those tasks
Chat 3: /tech-lead - Design architecture
Chat 4: /developer - Implement code
Chat 5: /qa-reviewer - Test and issue verdict
```

See `roles/README.md` or `.prompts/README.md` for details.
